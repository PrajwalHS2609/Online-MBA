      </h2>
      <p>
        An Online MBA is a two-year postgraduate program that has emerged as a
        preferred choice for professionals seeking to advance their
        qualifications and deepen their business expertise. Designed with
        flexibility and accessibility in mind, it delivers the same
        comprehensive and rigorous curriculum as traditional on-campus programs.
        The primary objective of an Online MBA is to equip learners with a
        holistic understanding of business administration while enabling them to
        develop specialized managerial and leadership skills from the comfort of
        their own space. With its ability to blend quality education and
        convenience, the Online MBA has become increasingly popular among
        working professionals aspiring to accelerate their careers and move into
        managerial roles across diverse industries.
